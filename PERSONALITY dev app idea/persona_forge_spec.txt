Project Spec: PersonaForge (Codename: Forge)

Overview
Forge is a mobile app where users are guided by fictional characters who deliver hard-hitting, five-minute
daily challenges in four life areas: physical, mental, social, and productive. Each user selects from predefined
coaches like Tyler Durden or Batman, who challenge the user in their unique voice and philosophy. This app
isn't about 'tracking habits'-it's about building personality through daily micro-tests of courage, strength, and
focus.

Target Audience
